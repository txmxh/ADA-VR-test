# Keystroke Dynamics Authentication 
This project demonstrates behavioral authentication using inter-key timings. The user enrolls with 5 password attempts; typing rhythms are averaged and compared on login using Euclidean distance.

## Features
- Console-based (Windows, uses `msvcrt`)
- Records and prints the inter-key timing vector
- Access granted or denied based on timing similarity (bio-metrics)

## Usage
1. Install numpy (if you havenâ€™t yet):  pip install numpy
2. Run the script: python keystroke_auth.py
3. Follow the prompts in the terminal.
